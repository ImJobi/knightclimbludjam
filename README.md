# KnightClimb
 Hi, I'm Jordan, or Jobi, or DorbanDurbawak on twitch.
 
 I hope I did this right I dont use git much and may have messed up the gitignore. Let me know if anything is misssing.
 
 I made this game for Ludwig's Foddian game jam.
 I made the music, did the programming, and also made some of the pixel art in the game.
 It was a great experience for learning unity. 
 This is the first full game I have completed.
 
 If you would like to play the game without building it yourself, you can download it or play it in browser at https://imjobi.itch.io/knight-climb
